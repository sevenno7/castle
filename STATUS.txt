Status of 1.0.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r2500
    Treat compiler warnings as errors, except for warning CS1591 ('Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member
	'Type_or_Member'') and a few very specific warnings in specific projects (DP2).
    On framework 2.0 it will throw ConfigurationErrorsException instead of the deprecated ConfigurationException. This is a
	breaking change.
    In general all deprecated code is modified to compile without warnings on 2.0.

  * r2504,2543
    Applied (with reformatting) patch by William C. Pierce <wcpierce@gmail.com> adding PerWebRequestAttribute
	Notes:
      The change in 2504 fails the build because of a missing file, 2543 corrects this.

    Put a link to CastleKey.snk in VS2005 projects.
	Trunk version of patch:
      http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2512
	Justification:
	It's part of the 'productizing' of this branch: make a good user experience. If the projects are complete and compile
	right away in Studio it'll make us look good.
