Status of 1.0.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r2500
    Treat compiler warnings as errors, except for warning CS1591 ('Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member
	'Type_or_Member'') and a few very specific warnings in specific projects (DP2).
    On framework 2.0 it will throw ConfigurationErrorsException instead of the deprecated ConfigurationException. This is a
	breaking change.
    In general all deprecated code is modified to compile without warnings on 2.0.

  * r2504,2543
    Applied (with reformatting) patch by William C. Pierce <wcpierce@gmail.com> adding PerWebRequestAttribute
	Notes:
      The change in 2504 fails the build because of a missing file, 2543 corrects this.
	Trunk version of patch:

       +1: roelofb
	   -1: hammett (we have not tested it)
	-1: hconceicao (not tested, it isn't a demand)
	   
  * r2512
    Put a link to CastleKey.snk in VS2005 projects.
	Trunk version of patch:
      http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2512
	Justification:
	It's part of the 'productizing' of this branch: make a good user experience. If the projects are complete and compile
	right away in Studio it'll make us look good.

  * r2546
    Applied recommended practice to rethrow exceptions, in order to fix SERVICES-5.
  Trunk version of patch:
    http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2546
  Justification:
    SERVICES-5 was about exceptions thrown by AutomaticTransactionFacility
    losing their stack traces. I think this one is quite serious.

  * r2622
	Enhanced HqlBasedQuery.PrepareQueryForCount.
	Trunk version of patch:
     http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2622
	Justification:
	Needed so HqlBasedQuery.Count() can strips "fetch" joins.
	In HQL, "fetch" joins crashes when used together with "select count(*)".

  * r2623
	Introduced ARPagination.CreatePagination<T>(SimpleQuery<T>).
	Trunk version of patch:
     http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2623
	Justification:
	A simpler way to perform pagination with complex data, generated
	from an HQL query.

  * r2677
	Fixed a bug in ActiveRecordBaseQuery.Clone().
	Trunk version of patch:
     http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2677
	Justification:
	The bug is somewhat serious: if a query does not have any modifiers
	(such as parameters or ranges), trying to clone it throws a NullReferenceException.

  * r2770
    Added ActiveRecordMediator.Refresh(), both generic and non-generic.
  Trunk version of patch:
    http://fisheye3.cenqua.com/changelog/castleproject/?cs=2770
  Justification:
    ActiveRecordBase already contains that method.
  Votes:
    +1: fabiob

  * r2771
    Fixed a bug in PaginationHelper.CreatePageLink(): the dictionary received 
    as parameter could be a read-only dictionary, in which case, a new one 
    must be created. Quite an unusual scenario, but real.
