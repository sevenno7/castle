  * r2500
    Treat compiler warnings as errors, except for warning CS1591 ('Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member
	'Type_or_Member'') and a few very specific warnings in specific projects (DP2).
    On framework 2.0 it will throw ConfigurationErrorsException instead of the deprecated ConfigurationException. This is a
	breaking change.
    In general all deprecated code is modified to compile without warnings on 2.0.
